# `microdf` roadmap

`microdf` currently provides capabilities for analyzing weighted microdata, including statistics, distributional tables, graphs, and special functions for working with PSL Tax-Calculator. In the future, it will provide more functionality, including:
* Charts showing distributional changes between a baseline and reform policy
* Extending these charts to more than one reform
* Presets for working with common datasets, e.g. suggesting the appropriate weight for SCF and CPS
* Standard error calculations for surveys with replicate weight files

See the [issues page](https://github.com/PSLmodels/microdf/issues) to view and suggest other items.
